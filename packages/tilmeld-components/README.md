# Tilmeld Components - User/Group System for Nymph

Powerful object data storage and querying.

The Tilmeld Components are front end registration/login, account recovery, account details, and password change components build with (Svelte)[https://svelte.dev/] and (SMUI)[https://sveltematerialui.com/].

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @nymphjs/tilmeld-components
```

## Usage

You need to have an SMUI theme compiled and installed on your front end app. If you're using Svelte, you need to have TypeScript support and you should use the 'svelte' mainfield from package.json.
