# Nymph PubSub Server

Powerful object data storage and querying.

The PubSub server provides a WebSocket server that allows Nymph to publish changes and the Nymph Client to subscribe to those changes. You can subscribe to individual entities, entity queries, or UIDs.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @nymphjs/pubsub
```

## Usage

Any Nymph instance will only publish changes if you initialize PubSub publisher before Nymph is used! This step is **absolutely required** to have a working PubSub system.

```ts
import SQLite3Driver from '@nymphjs/driver-sqlite3';
import { Nymph } from '@nymphjs/nymph';
import { PubSub } from '@nymphjs/pubsub';

const pubSubConfig = {
  entries: ['ws://yourpubsubserver.tld:8080/'], // This should be set to your PubSub server URL(s).
};

const nymph = new Nymph(
  {},
  new SQLite3Driver({
    filename: ':memory:', // Put the correct driver/config here.
  })
);
PubSub.initPublisher(pubSubConfig, nymph);
```

Now, on your PubSub server, you can use the createServer function to create a new PubSub server using HTTP (without TLS). If you want, this can be done on the same server you use as a REST server, with a different port.

```ts
import SQLite3Driver from '@nymphjs/driver-sqlite3';
import { Nymph } from '@nymphjs/nymph';
import createServer, { PubSub } from '@nymphjs/pubsub';

const pubSubConfig = {
  originIsAllowed: (origin) => {
    // Your logic to determine allowed origins goes here.
    return true;
  },
  entries: ['ws://yourpubsubserver.tld:8080/'],
};

const nymph = new Nymph(
  {},
  new SQLite3Driver({
    filename: ':memory:', // Put the correct driver/config here.
  })
);
// Don't forget to do this; even here!
PubSub.initPublisher(pubSubConfig, nymph);

const pubsub = createServer(8080, pubSubConfig, nymph);
```

If you need to provide custom handling in your server (like TLS), you can use the PubSub class directly and provide it a WebSocket server instance.

```ts
import http from 'http';
import { server as WebSocketServer } from 'websocket';
import SQLite3Driver from '@nymphjs/driver-sqlite3';
import { Nymph } from '@nymphjs/nymph';
import { PubSub } from '@nymphjs/pubsub';

const pubSubConfig = {
  originIsAllowed: (origin) => {
    // Your logic to determine allowed origins goes here.
    return true;
  },
  entries: ['ws://yourpubsubserver.tld:8080/'],
};

// Set up Nymph.
const nymph = new Nymph(
  {},
  new SQLite3Driver({
    filename: ':memory:', // Put the correct driver/config here.
  })
);
// Don't forget to do this; even here!
PubSub.initPublisher(pubSubConfig, nymph);

// Set up the PubSub server.
const port = 8080;
const server = http.createServer((_request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(404);
  response.end();
});
const listener = server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(
    new Date().toISOString(),
    `Nymph-PubSub server started listening on port ${port}.`
  );
});
const wsServer = new WebSocketServer({
  httpServer: listener,
  // You should not use autoAcceptConnections for production
  // applications, as it defeats all standard cross-origin protection
  // facilities built into the protocol and the browser.  You should
  // *always* verify the connection's origin and decide whether or not
  // to accept it.
  autoAcceptConnections: false,
});

const pubsub = new PubSub(pubSubConfig, nymph, wsServer);
```
